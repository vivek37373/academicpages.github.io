Iâ€™m **Vivek**, a PhD student at NIPGR, New Delhi. I'm a **bioinformatician** by training with a background in bioinformatics and biotechnology, but I have just enough expertise in RNA informatics and big data. My previous research and current work are all grounded to the constant urge to developing workflows/pipelines/methodologies to identify **plant ncRNAs**.
