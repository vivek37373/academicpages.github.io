 Welcome to my personal webpage! As a PhD student in the field of non-coding RNA research in plants, I bring a strong background and passion to this rapidly evolving field. My PhD research focuses on the identification of major classes of non-coding RNAs from RNA-seq datasets, and I have gained valuable experience handling large datasets and utilizing a wide range of bioinformatics tools to perform analyses.

I specialize in developing pipelines for non-coding RNA projects and have a keen interest in designing and implementing bioinformatics analysis that lead to the creation of useful databases and tools for the non-coding RNA research community. I believe that collaboration and the sharing of knowledge is key to advancing this field, and I am always eager to work with others to achieve common goals.

Whether you are a fellow researcher, a student interested in the field, or simply someone with a curious mind, I invite you to take a look around my personal webpage to learn more about my work, my experience, and my passion for non-coding RNA research in plants.
