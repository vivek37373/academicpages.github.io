Iâ€™m Vivek, a bioinformatician mostly working on distinct ncRNA types present in plants using large-scale RNA-seq data sets.

I have graduated with Bioinformatics and Biotechnology in my bachelor's and master's degrees. Currently, I'm a PhD student exploring non-coding RNAs using using a wide-range of bioinformatics approaches. 

My research interests mainly focus on developing workflows/pipelines/methodologies to identify plant ncRNAs.
