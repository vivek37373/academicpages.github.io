        Iâ€™m **Vivek**, a PhD student at NIPGR, New Delhi.  I'm a trained **bioinformatician** with a background in bioinformatics and biotechnology, but I also have some knowledge of molecular biology techniques. My previous research and current work are all motivated by the desire to create workflows/pipelines/methodologies for identifying **plant ncRNAs**.
