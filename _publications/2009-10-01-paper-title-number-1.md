excerpt: 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous non-coding, small RNAs that are associated with the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. In plants, few miRNAs are highly conserved, that may have the same ancestor in the early stages of evolution. This fact allows the detection of conserved miRNAs in various plant species, especially in those that lack genome sequence information. Though the draft genome of the orphan crop, Lens culinaris Medik. (Lentil) is published, its complete genome assembly is still underway. In this computational study, an EST and GSS based comparative genomics approach were conducted to identify miRNAs in Lentils. The adopted approach was on the basis of a search for sequence similarity followed by series of filtering steps to provide reliable and precise results, eliminating the false-positive predictions. This study reports 24 miRNAs from 10,190 ESTs and 715 GSSs in â€¦'
