excerpt: 'Plants have evolved many defense strategies for combating viral infections. One major surveillance strategy adopted by them is manipulating viral sequences to generate distinct small RNA products via Dicer-like enzymes (DCL), and thereby restricting virus multiplication through the RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism. The power of high-throughput sequencing technologies, with diverse computational tools to handle small RNA sequencing (sRNA-Seq) data, bestows unprecedented opportunities to answer fundamental questions in plant virology. Here, we present some basic concepts of virus-derived, small interfering RNA (vsiRNA) biogenesis in plants, optimization strategies, caveats, and best practices for efficient discovery and diagnosis of known as well as novel plant viruses/viroids using deep sequencing of small RNA (sRNA) pools.'
